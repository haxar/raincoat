BRIEFLY

Raincoat is a small Linux app which knows how to reflash your Xbox.
Here is the list of chips it supports (note this list is deprecated, 
run ./parseTypes.sh for a complete list):

  SST49LF020					256KByte   Cheapmod, Xodus, OzXchip...
  Am29F080B						1024KByte  v1.0/v1.1 Motherboard
  Fujitsu MBM29F080A			1024KByte  v1.0/v1.1 Motherboard
  Hynix HY29F080				1024KByte  v1.0/v1.1 Motherboard
  ST M29F080A					1024KByte  v1.0/v1.1 Motherboard
  Sharp LHF08CH1				1024KByte  v1.0/v1.1 Motherboard  [1]
  Winbond W49F020				256KByte   v1.2 Motherboard [2]
  ST M29f002BT					256KByte   v1.2/v1.3 [3]
  AMD - Am29F040B				512KByte   Found in some 29wire mods
  Winbond - W49F002U			256KByte   v1.2/v1.3[3]
  MACRONIX - MX29F022NTPC	256KByte   v1.2/v1.3 [3]
  AMD - Am29LV800B			1024KByte  Chaemeleon [4]

[1] Sharp TSOP LHF08CH1/28F008 confirmed working thanks to Daniel 
Jonsson.  NOTE that for the Sharp chip you must link TSOP.p11 to 
+5V.  A testpad for TSOP pin11 can be found on the reverse of the 
PCB, see NC11 on Bunnie's diagram here:

[2] Thanks to WaferJ from xboxhacker for testing.  W49F020 has no 
block erase, only chip erase.  Chip erase is only allowed by raincoat 
if the two kinds of block erase failed to work and you are writing the 
whole 256KBytes starting from the beginning, as a safety feature.
Note that on the v1.2 motherboard the bridge points for nWE and nOE
on the TSOP are in a different place than the v1.0 and v1.1.

[3] Thanks to OzShadow (OzXchip) for pointing these guys out and
sending us the info these should all be fairly straight forward

[4] Xodus/Chaemeleon untested, hopefully it will be tested soon

INSTALLING

Distributions of raincoat now include a staticly-linked executable
called raincoat.  This is ready to run.

If you got raincoat as a tar, untar it into your home directory on
your Xbox like this:

# tar xzf raincoat-0.5.tar.gz

This will create a raincoat directory.  (You will already have this
directory is you got it from CVS.)  Enter the directory

# cd raincoat

To remake raincoat, you do the following:

# make
# su <give root password, xbox by default>
# make install

Now you can use raincoat from any directory


USING

You have to be root to use raincoat.

raincoat looks at a file /etc/raincoat.conf for details on
what flashes it can support.  This file is in the same format
as the EvoX flash definitions to minimize confusions.  Here is
a sample line:

Flash = 0xbf61,"SST SST49LF020",0x40000

The first number is the manufacturer/device ID for this kind of
flash.  The string is the user-presentable name of the flash
chip.  lastly is the size of the flash device in bytes.

If /etc/raincoat.conf is not available, raincoat uses a built-in list
of known flash devices which it supports.


The help that raincoat gives with no arguments is self-
explanitory for the rest of the functionality:


raincoat Flasher  0.5  Apr  14 2003  andy@warmcat.com  http://xbox-linux.sf.net
Reading /etc/raincoat.conf

Detected: SST SST49LF020 (256K)

raincoat [-p filetoprog] [-r filetodumpto] [-a hexoffset] [-v]

 -p filetoprog    Program flash with given file
 -r filetodumpto  Read whole flash back into file
 -a hexoffset     Optional start offset in flash, default 0
 -v               Verbose informational messages

Example:  raincoat -p cromwell.bin

Please note, -p will reprogram your BIOS flash
  Please do not use if you don't understand what that
  means, there is no simple undo for this if you
  programmed the wrong thing.
  -r is always safe to use, as is running with no args



Something that is not obvious is that raincoat only erases the
minimum possible footprint in the flash necessary to reprogram
the area used by the file being programmed.

Most flashes offer 64KByte or less block erase capability, and
it is this that is used in raincoat.  Together with the -a switch
this allows multiple files to be programmed into different
quadrants of a large flash device completely independently.  For
example:

raincoat -a 80000 -p myfile.bin

will reprogram the third quarter of a 1MByte flash only, assuming
myfile.bin is 256KBytes.  The other four quarters will be
completely untouched.
